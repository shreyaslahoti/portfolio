A zipped file consisting of a PowerPoint document as described below as well as the supporting Tableau (twbx) workbook, PowerBI file, rmd file, and d3 files (should include an html, css, and js file).
Provided a data set concerning schools that offer some form of doctoral degree. UT Dallas has created a set of categories of “aspire,” “peer,” and “other” (smaller schools, private schools, etc.) and assigned one of these categories to each school (note – these school categories were assigned for the purposes of this class, they are not official designations. All other data is valid). UT Dallas has identified the five attributes below as “target” attributes which are key to achieving aspirational status.
•	Graduation rate - Bachelor degree within 5 years, total
•	Total  enrollment
•	Percent admitted – total
•	Applicants total 
•	Endowment
UT Dallas would like to understand how it should direct resources and make plans to improve its standing in one or more of the five attributes listed above. Using visualizations as described below, groups should identify relationships among the remaining attributes and the five attributes listed above and then use this visualization to support a recommendation UT Dallas can take to achieve aspirational status. Recommendations need to be realistic and practical. For instance, increasing the number of PhD students raises expenses; increasing the number of graduate students takes seats from undergraduates who are more likely as alumni to make donations. Sometimes suggesting “more” or “less” is not sophisticated enough to be of value

A PowerPoint with the following slides, with each of the first six slides consisting of a single graph and a single recommendation supported by insights from the accompanying graph:
•	Slides 1-4: A bubbleplot in each of Tableau, PowerBI, ggplot, and d3
•	Slides 5: A graph using any tool and type graph we have discussed in class
•	Slide 6: No graph, just a summary of the set of recommendations
